                        <p>Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power 
                        lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So here's 
                        the fundamental climatological question. "What's the weather like 
                        as we approach the equator?" Now, we know what you may be 
                        thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..." But, if pressed, how would you 
                        prove it?  Well, that's what we are going to attempt to do.

                        <p>To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the 
                        OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset of over 500 cities located
                        at random latitudes or distances from the equator. We then used 
                        Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather versus the 
                        latitude for each city. Factors considered were temperature,
                        cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source 
                        data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well 
                        as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations 
                        witnessed.
